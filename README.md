## Introduction
### Scenario
The director of marketing believes the company’s future success
depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to
understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these
insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual
members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be
backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations. 
## Problems
Future growth depends on annual members, but currently, marketing targets broad segments.
Casual riders already know the brand; they are the easiest segment to convert.
## Solutions
Use data to find the behavioral gap between the two groups so marketing can bridge it.
